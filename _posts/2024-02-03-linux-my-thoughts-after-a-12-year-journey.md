Let me share what I've learned after 13 years of using Linux as my main operating system.

## Background

I started using Linux in 2011, I was a Windows user, but I was curious about Linux, so I decided to give it a try. I started with Ubuntu, and I was very happy with it, but I wanted to learn more about Linux, so I decided to try ArchLinux, and I've been using it since then.
